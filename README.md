# HOW TO COMPILE
To compile the visual studio solution you'll need to download the Vektoria Engine Library and place the Lib folder in the same directory as the App folder.

The project was created for the Vektoria V23.22 version and should work for any version later than that.

### VEKTORIA DOWNLOAD
To download the Vektoria Library head to the Website of the [Kempten University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-kempten.de/fakultaet-informatik/zentrale-einrichtungen/computerspiel-zentrum-games/vektoria) and click on Vektoria Download.

Download the newest version and place the Lib folder at the desired destination.

### VEKTORIA ENGINE
The Vektoria game engine is used intensively for teaching in the Game Engineering course at Kempten University of Applied Sciences. Tobias Breiner is mainly responsible for the development.

Resources such as manuals, sample projects and FAQs for the engine can be downloaded from this page.
